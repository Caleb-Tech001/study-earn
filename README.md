💡 Inspiration and Problem Statement

Education costs across Africa are rising rapidly. In Nigeria alone, private school fees have increased by up to 200 percent in the last five years.
Sub Saharan Africa has over 98 million children out of school, while many students who remain enrolled struggle with financial pressure and debt.

Students are often forced to choose between academic success and financial survival.

StudyEarn was created to change this reality by turning learning into a source of income rather than a financial burden.
